# Fossil-Fuel_CO-_emissions_Study
 Global, regional, and national fossil-fuel CO₂ emissions. 
 Study from Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 
 U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, U.S.A., 2017

We want to analyse these data to see the evolution and be able to estimate the future emissions of CO2: 

Year	Emissions  (Global CO₂ emissions from 2004 to 2014, in millions of tons of carbon.)
2004	7743
2005	8042
2006	8336
2007	8503
2008	8776
2009	8697
2010	9128
2011	9503
